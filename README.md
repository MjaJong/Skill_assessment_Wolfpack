WolfAPI uses two Nuget packages:
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory

The SqlServer package has subparts that are subject to one of three licensing terms:
The Apache Licence 2.0
The MIT license
Or a license written by Microsoft, see: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en/dotnet_library_license.htmfor the license terms.

The InMemory package is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

Both the Apache License and the MIT license have been included in full in the license file. The specific license used depends on the sub library itself.
